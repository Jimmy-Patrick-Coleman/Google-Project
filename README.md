This is a reupload of my original project it was made for The Odin Project.

It had to be deleted because reuploading was faster than dealing with changing the remote url as i messed that up.
Its sad i lost the commit timeline though as you can no longer see how the code developed over the week.
Although its in the readme of all the reuploads the saddest one.
I finaly got the hang of uploading to git with this one and made sure to give good stage progression on it but i had to make a more approprate username to use.
This is my Google Homepage Remake.
